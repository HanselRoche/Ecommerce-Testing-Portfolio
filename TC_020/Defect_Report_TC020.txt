Summary: System allows checkout process to initiate with an Empty Cart.

Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium

Description:
The application allows a user to proceed through the entire checkout flow even if there are 0 items in the cart. Most e-commerce platforms disable the checkout button when the cart is empty to prevent empty orders.

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Ensure the cart is empty (Badge is not visible).
3. Click the Cart icon.
4. Click the 'Checkout' button.

Expected Result:
The 'Checkout' button should be disabled (grayed out) OR clicking it should display an error: "Your cart is empty."

Actual Result:
System redirects user to the 'Checkout: Your Information' page, allowing the process to continue.
