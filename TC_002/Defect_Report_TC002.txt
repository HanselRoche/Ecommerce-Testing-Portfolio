Summary: Checkout module accepts invalid Special Characters in 'Zip Code' field.

Severity: Medium
Priority: Low (Does not crash the system, but allows bad data)

Description:
The application allows users to enter special characters (e.g., "!!!!") into the Zip/Postal Code field during checkout. The system should validate this input and reject it, but instead, it accepts the data and proceeds to the Payment Overview page.

Pre-Conditions:
1. User is logged in as 'standard_user'.
2. User has at least one item in the cart.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the Cart and click 'Checkout'.
2. Enter valid data in 'First Name' and 'Last Name'.
3. In the 'Zip/Postal Code' field, enter: !!!!
4. Click the 'Continue' button.

Expected Result:
The system should display an error message: "Error: Invalid Zip Code format" and prevent the user from proceeding.

Actual Result:
The system accepts the special characters and redirects the user to the "Checkout: Overview" page.
