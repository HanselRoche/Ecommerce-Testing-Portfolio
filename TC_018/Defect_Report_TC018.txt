Summary: 'Reset App State' clears cart data but fails to reset UI button states.

Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium (User Confusion)

Description:
The 'Reset App State' function successfully clears the number of items in the cart (backend), but the Inventory UI does not refresh to reflect this. Items previously added still show a "Remove" button instead of reverting to "Add to cart".

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in as 'standard_user'.
2. Click 'Add to cart' on any item (e.g., Backpack).
3. Open the Burger Menu (top left).
4. Click 'Reset App State'.
5. Close the menu and observe the Backpack item.

Expected Result:
The cart badge should disappear, AND the button on the Backpack should revert to "Add to cart".

Actual Result:
The cart badge disappears (Correct), but the button still says "Remove" (Incorrect UI State).
